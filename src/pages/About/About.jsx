      <p>
        Young, promising and confident person.
        <br />I easily find a common language with people and I like to develop.
        <br />I am engaged in programming web applications and I feel that I
        have found myself in this.
        <br />I want to become a middle developer in a couple of years, and
        after a while I want to become a senior. Big plans and big dreams..
